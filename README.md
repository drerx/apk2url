# apk2url

apk2url easily extracts URL and IP endpoints from an APK file to a .txt output. This is suitable for information gathering by red team, penetration testers and developers to quickly identify endpoints associated with an application.

**Note:** apk2url disassembles to Smali and performs Java decompilation to identify URLs and IPs.

*Inspired by [diggy](https://github.com/s0md3v/Diggy), apk2url is rewritten and upgraded with IP support, stronger regex, filtering and Jadx decompilation.*

## Usage
```bash
./apk2url.sh /path/to/apk/file.apk
```

You can also install directly for easy access by running `./install.sh`.                        
After that you can run apk2url anywhere:
```bash
apk2url /path/to/apk/file.apk
```
By default there are 2 output files in the "endpoints" directory:  
- \<apkname\>_endpoints.txt - **Contains endpoints with url paths, has duplicates**
- \<apkname\>_uniqurls.txt - **Contains unique endpoints**

By default, the program does not log the path where endpoints are discovered.    
To enable logging, run as follows:

```bash
apk2url /path/to/apk/file.apk log
```
**Tested on Kali 2023.2 and Ubuntu 22.04*
